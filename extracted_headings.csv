"""If This Visit Was Conducted By Means Of Telehealth Services, The Patient Desired To Initiate Telehealth Services With Me As The Provider.Â  If This Visit Was Conducted By Means Of Telehealth Services, This Visit Was Conducted With The Use Of An Interactive Audio And Video Telecommunications System That Permits Real-Time Communication Between Patient And Provider. If This Visit Was Conducted By Means Of Telehealth Services, I Explained To The Patient How Telehealth Would Be Used To Conduct Such A Consultation, And They Acknowledged It Is Acceptable And Also Not The Same As A Direct Patient/Provider Visit Due To The Fact That They The Patient Would Not Be In The Same Physical Room With Me As Provider. Certain Aspects Of The Visit That Normally Require Such Physical Presence, Such As Physical Exam Or Vitals, May Not Take Place, And Patient Understood And Consented To This."""
